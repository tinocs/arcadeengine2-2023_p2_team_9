Added gravity and other player movement to the goomba. 

**5/26/2023 - school (90 min)**
made the dead goomba stay in the air rather than float in the air. Spit anc cut spirte sheet Made the pipe class which displays a pipe facing up. Acts just like brick with collisions. 

**5/26/2023 - home (20 min)**
Added collision with pipe in enemy class to help goomba collision. Adding this to enemy super class makes collsions with other enemies more streamlined.

fixed mario-goomba collision to make it jump when killing goomba. going to try to make it go through after killing it. Pushed on 3/1/2023

**6/1/2023 - school (90min)**
fully made the makePipe method. You can feed it a height and direction and it will create a Pipe with that height and direction. I used an extra two variables named: h and dir. For directon, 1 is up, 2 is right, 3 is left.
