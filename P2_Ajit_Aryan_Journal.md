**5/8/2023 - school (? min)**
I updated and fixed the getHeight and getWidth method to work. Started on the getIntersectingObject methods.

**5/9/2023 - school and home (? min)**
Updated and fixed the world class to fit the issues. World class had issues. Me and Ishaan both worked on my computer. I fixed the Keycode problem which need a set rather than a Arraylist. Patched up scene listener to work only if world is null. Attempted to fix getObjects and getObjectsAt.

**5/11/2023 - home (? min)**
met online to completely update and fix the world and actor engines. Fixed sceneProperty, getintersectingObejects and getoneINtersectingobects. Updated keysPressed to get the code of the keyevent and add to the set List. Fixed getObjects and getObjectAt. Fixed a bug in the the isStopped method where we accidently return whether the game was running **not** if the game was stopped. Fixed remove Actor. Passed all tests

**5/19/2023 - school (? min)**
Me and my team came together in Mr McLeod's room to work on the project.We  created the breakout branch and started on creating the different class. We split the classes, where I worked on the ball class. I created the border controls which bounces off the wall.

**5/13/2023 - home (? min)**
Pushed, but barely any work was done

**5/14/2023 - home (? min)**
Fixed up the ball class. Made the images visible on the paddle and ball classes, and added the collison code for ball with paddle.

**5/15/2023 - school (? min)**
Tested out paddle visibility and collsion. Created mouse handler for the paddle.

**5/16/2023 -> 5/17/2023 - home (3 hours 10:30ish to 1:30ish ) **
Sat down and finsihed all of the game. Started by update ball-brick collsion. The ball would touch the brick: the brick would remove it self from the world, the ball would bounce off the brick with advanced bouncing movement. I create left and right keys for the movement of the paddle, with border controls.
Fully created score class with contructor  and update of display. tested it out in ballWorld. added code that changed the score and display if the ball touched the brick(+points) or the ground(-points).
