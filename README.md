## Game Proposal ##

This will be our adaptation of **Super Mario Bro** from the year 1985. We will be making an exact replica of the game, but with 1 or 2 levels, less enemies, and less power-up. We don't think we will able to figure out the exact physics or the game so were going to make more block animation. Everything else will be the exact same. There will the exact same powerups as in the first and second levels, animation, and pictures.

Game Controls:

+ Up || W - jump
+ right || D - move right
+ left || A - move left
+ shift - shoot fireballs

Game Elements:

+ Simple falling physics
+ If you punch a block above you, your will either break the block, or change the block, or change the block and get a power-up from it 
+ Simple moving animation for both the enemies and the player
+ If you are in your base state(the same size as when you start the level) and you get hit by a enemy, you immediatly die and lose a life
+ If you eat a super mushroom you get increased jump, physical height along with abilty to take more damage
+ If you fll into the abyss, you die and lose a life, no matter what state your in.
+ If you eat a fire mushroom, you get the ability to throw fireball(burst of 2)
+ Question blocks drop powerups
+ If you die with 0 lives, you get a game over message an start from the beginning.
+ When you finish a level you slide down a pole to get to the caste

How to Win:

+ CLear all levels using your limited 3 lives and get the you win screen
